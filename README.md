# FilaScale

This is a small board designed to fit directly behind a standard 2.8" SPI-driven QVGA TFT touchscreen.
It was built to the requirements of a filament monitoring device.  The board provides:

* Humidity, temperature and weight monitoring of a spool of filament in a drybox
* RFID tag reader for spool inventory management
* QVGA display with touchscreen for user interface
* SDCard for logging, local configuration
* Expansion interfaces (two SPI, one I2C)
* Serial communications with a host
* Wifi and bluetooth connectivity
